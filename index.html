            <h2>LEARNING RESOURCES</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to become a Software Developer without any prior
                experience, here are some valuable tips to get you started:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I would say that every new developer should first spend around 1-3 months learning <em>HTML &
                        CSS</em>. These are the <em>Front-End</em> scripting & styling languages that give a webpage
                    it's content & visual design. The <em>JavaScript</em> programming language adds functionality to a
                    webpage & goes hand in hand with HTML & CSS, so it makes a lot of sense to learn JavaScript right
                    after HTML & CSS. JavaScript has a steeper learning curve you shouls spend at least 6 months
                    studying this. <br><br>
                    Define your goals and choose a programming language: Determine which
                    area of software development interests you the most, such as web
                    development, mobile app development, or data science. Based on your
                    interests, select a programming language to focus on, such as
                    <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em>, or <em>Java</em>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Start with online tutorials and courses: There are numerous free
                    learning resources available online that can help you kickstart your
                    learning journey. Here are some platforms that you can get started with:

                            The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was
                            learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer
                            science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding
                            school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This
                            project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying
                            to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <div class="container-b">
                <p class="left">Software development is considered a great industry to be in for several reasons:
                    <br><br>
                    1. <strong>High Demand</strong>: The demand for software and technology solutions continues to grow
                    rapidly across various sectors and industries. Almost every aspect of modern life relies on
                    software, from smartphones and web applications to automation in industries like healthcare,
                    finance, transportation, and more. This high demand ensures a steady flow of job opportunities for
                    software developers.
                    <br><br>
                    2. <strong>Lucrative Salaries</strong>: Software developers often enjoy competitive salaries and
                    benefits due to the demand for their skills. The industry offers attractive compensation packages,
                    especially for experienced and skilled professionals. Additionally, software developers have the
                    potential to earn even more through bonuses, stock options, or by working on freelance projects.
                    <br><br>
                    3. <strong>Continuous Learning and Innovation</strong>: The field of software development is dynamic
                    and constantly evolving. It requires individuals to stay updated with the latest technologies,
                    programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies. This continuous learning environment provides
                    opportunities for personal and professional growth, making it an intellectually stimulating industry
                    to work in.
                    <br><br>
                    4. <strong>Flexibility and Remote Work</strong>: Software development jobs often offer flexible work
                    arrangements. Many companies allow developers to work remotely or have flexible schedules, providing
                    a better work-life balance. Remote work has become even more prevalent due to advancements in
                    communication technology, allowing developers to work from anywhere and collaborate with teams
                    across the globe.
                    <br><br>
                    5. <strong>Creative Problem Solving</strong>: Software developers face complex problems on a daily
                    basis and need to come up with creative solutions. They have the opportunity to analyze challenges,
                    design innovative solutions, and see their ideas come to life through coding. This aspect of
                    problem-solving and creative thinking makes software development a rewarding and intellectually
                    stimulating profession.
                    <br><br>
                    6. <strong>Entrepreneurial Opportunities</strong>: Software development offers opportunities for
                    entrepreneurship. Developers can create their own software products, start tech companies, or work
                    on freelance projects. The industry is conducive to innovation, and developers can bring their ideas
                    to market and have a significant impact on society.
                    <br><br>
                    7. <strong>Collaboration and Teamwork</strong>: Software development projects often require
                    collaboration with other professionals, such as designers, product managers, and quality assurance
                    engineers. Working in teams allows developers to learn from others, share knowledge, and contribute
                    to larger projects. Collaboration and teamwork foster personal growth and help create better
                    software solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    8. <strong>Global Job Market</strong>: Software development skills are in demand worldwide. This
                    means that software developers have the flexibility to work in different countries or even remotely
                    for international companies. The global job market provides a vast range of opportunities and the
                    potential for international travel and exposure to diverse cultures and work environments.
                    <br><br>
                    These factors contribute to making software development a great industry to be in, attracting
                    individuals who are passionate about technology, enjoy problem-solving, and seek opportunities for
                    growth and impact.<br> <br>
